            <h2>What is Formula 1?</h2>
            <p>Formula 1 (F1) is the highest class of single-seater auto racing. It features high-speed races in which
                drivers compete to be the first to cross the finish line. It is a global sport with races held on
                circuits around the world.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Basic Rules of F1</h2>
            <p>Here are some key rules that govern F1 races:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Race Distance:</strong> A Formula 1 race is usually held over a set distance or time.
                    Typically, a race lasts about 1.5 to 2 hours, and the driver with the most laps completed is the
                    winner.</li>
                <li><strong>Points System:</strong> Points are awarded to the top 10 finishers in each race. The winner
                    gets 25 points, second place gets 18 points, and so on, down to 10th place (1 point).</li>
                <li><strong>Pit Stops:</strong> During a race, drivers must make at least one pit stop to change tires.
                    Teams can also make repairs or adjustments during pit stops.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Safety is paramount. Each car is equipped with advanced safety features
                    like a halo device to protect the driver's head and a strong chassis to withstand crashes.</li>
                <li><strong>Yellow and Red Flags:</strong> A yellow flag signals caution (e.g., slow down due to an
                    accident), while a red flag means the race is stopped completely, often due to unsafe conditions.
                </li>
                <li><strong>DRS (Drag Reduction System):</strong> DRS allows drivers to temporarily reduce drag by
                    adjusting their rear wing, making it easier to overtake another driver. However, it can only be used
                    in certain conditions.</li>
            </ul>
